# book-searcher
My first React app, testing some stuff.. 

Created using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Installation:
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Description:
You can search for a book title using a search bar and a maximum of 10 possible options will show up on a list.
When you click any of them, the app will show some information about the title.

Book search made using [google-books-search](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-books-search) npm package.
